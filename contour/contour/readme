For running the application, in the terminal type the following

python Contour.py Latitude Longitude Length SamplingRate Name

where Latitude and Longitude are the lat and lon of the centre point.
Length is the distance of the area to be plotted.
SamplingRate is the interval in which the contour is to be sampled
Name is the name of the file to be produced.

eg: python Contour.py 19.13 72.34 1 0.01 temp

this produces a contour named temp with 19.13 and 72.34 as the centre, with an area of 1km x 1km sampled at 0.01 kms, ie having 10000 sample points.

The bounding coordinates are written in the file 'Name_bound.txt', in this case it being 'temp_bound.txt'
